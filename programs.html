                        Media Institute where we would learn how to film and edit.
                        Above is a picture of one of my videos for the final project of the
                        program. It was one of my best projects in the program during 
                        the span of time that we had. Our prompt for this project was 
                        to film something that we were passionate about and our
                        struggles with it. (<a onclick=" window.open('https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EdiYM_1GKyxvAAberz3z4anQW8jvETV2/view?usp=sharing')">Link</a> to Video)

                        of 2021, where I got to learn about coding and how to 
                        create websites. In GWC, I was able to learn how to use
                        the programming languages: HTML, CSS, and a little bit
                        of Java. Here are some of the works I did over the program!

                        Center was an art program that I went to to learn more
                        about art. In the program, our group was commissioned
                        by the city of Cambridge to create a mural on a 
                        building in Kendall Square. We were commissioned to 
                        make the building look less dull in the area it was 
                        located in. Each of the students in our program were 
                        required to create an artwork that would help represent
                        The Port, a place in Cambridge, then, we would all 
                        of our artwork into a collage. Here is my artwork 
                        that I did for the collage and our collage on the 
                        building in Kendall Square.
